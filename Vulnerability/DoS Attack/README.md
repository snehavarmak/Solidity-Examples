# DoS Attack

- A denial-of-service attack (DoS) aims to obstruct a network, server, or application’s ability to process requests from legitimate users. By sending more traffic and overloading the network, the attacker exhausts the servers’ memory and bandwidth. 

- Blockchains are the main target of DoS attacks to siphon off the wealth because of the enormous potential they hold. DoS attacks have happened to the most well-known cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin and Ethereum. 

## Types of DoS
- Unexpected Revert DoS
- Block Gas Limit DoS
  -   Gas Limit DoS – Unbounded Contract Operation
  -   Block Stuffing
- Owner Action

## Impact Of DoS Attack
The following are collateral losses that a DoS attack on the blockchain can bring about in addition to the suspension of smart contract operations:

- <b>Bloated ledger</b>: The blockchain ledger is where the transactions are recorded permanently. For double-spend checks, the blockchain nodes keep a copy of each transaction. The ledger can be overrun by spam transactions during a DoS attack.

- <b>Network traffic</b>: Every node in the blockchain receives a copy of the transaction. A DoS flooding may result in a large transaction volume in the peer to peer network, consuming the network bandwidth. 

- <b>Node failures</b>: Blockchain relies on nodes, which need software support to handle large amounts of data. The nodes may run out of memory during transaction flooding, stopping the operations.
