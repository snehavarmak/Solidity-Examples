# Insecure Arithmetic in Smart Contracts

Arithmetic vulnerabilities in smart contracts can lead to serious security issues such as overflows, underflows, and division by zero errors. This README provides an overview of insecure arithmetic, types of vulnerabilities, prevention strategies, and resources for understanding vulnerable code.

## Introduction

Arithmetic vulnerabilities occur when mathematical operations in smart contracts lead to incorrect or unintended results. These vulnerabilities can be exploited to drain funds, manipulate data, or cause denial of service.

## Types of Arithmetic Vulnerabilities

1. **Overflow**: Occurs when an arithmetic operation exceeds the maximum value a variable can hold, causing it to "wrap around" to a smaller value.
   
2. **Underflow**: Occurs when an arithmetic operation goes below the minimum value a variable can hold, causing it to "wrap around" to a larger value.

3. **Division by Zero**: Occurs when a division operation is performed with zero as the divisor, leading to a runtime error.

## Prevention Strategies

1. **Use SafeMath Libraries**: Utilize libraries like OpenZeppelin's SafeMath to perform safe arithmetic operations.
   
2. **Input Validation**: Ensure proper validation of inputs to prevent invalid or malicious values.

3. **Checks and Reverts**: Implement checks and revert the transaction if an arithmetic operation leads to an invalid state.

### Secure Implementation

A secure implementation using OpenZeppelin's SafeMath library.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

import "@openzeppelin/contracts/utils/math/SafeMath.sol";

contract SecureArithmetic {
    using SafeMath for uint256;
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    function deposit(uint256 amount) public {
        balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender].add(amount);
    }

    function withdraw(uint256 amount) public {
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount, "Insufficient balance");
        balances[msg.sender] = balances[msg.sender].sub(amount);
    }

    function divide(uint256 a, uint256 b) public pure returns (uint256) {
        require(b != 0, "Division by zero");
        return a.div(b);
    }
}
```
