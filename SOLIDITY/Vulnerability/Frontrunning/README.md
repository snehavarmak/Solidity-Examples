# Front-Running Vulnerability

Front-running is a critical issue in blockchain systems where an attacker intercepts and preemptively executes transactions before other participants. This README provides an overview of front-running, types, prevention strategies, and resources for understanding vulnerable code.

## Introduction

Front-running is a form of transaction manipulation where an attacker observes pending transactions on the blockchain and executes a similar transaction with higher gas fees to get their transaction processed first. This can result in significant losses for the original transaction initiator.

## Types of Front-Running

1. **Order Manipulation**: An attacker places a transaction with higher gas fees to change the order of execution, gaining an unfair advantage.
   
2. **Price Manipulation**: An attacker exploits price differences by executing a transaction just before a large order to profit from the resulting price movement.

3. **Arbitrage**: An attacker spots arbitrage opportunities between exchanges and uses front-running to capitalize on the price differences.

## Prevention Strategies

1. **Commit-Reveal Scheme**: Use a two-step process where users first commit to their transactions and reveal them later, preventing front-runners from seeing the details in advance.

2. **Random Delays**: Introduce random delays in transaction processing to make it difficult for attackers to predict the execution order.

3. **Transaction Encryption**: Encrypt transaction details so that they are not visible in the mempool until they are executed.

4. **Batch Processing**: Process transactions in batches rather than individually to obscure the execution order.

5. **Priority Gas Auctions**: Use mechanisms like Flashbots to protect transactions from front-running by submitting them directly to miners.

### Secure Implementation

A secure implementation using a commit-reveal scheme to prevent front-running.

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract SecureSwap {
    struct Commit {
        bytes32 hash;
        uint256 amount;
    }

    mapping(address => Commit) public commits;
    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;
    uint256 public price = 1 ether;

    function deposit() public payable {
        balances[msg.sender] += msg.value;
    }

    function commitSwap(bytes32 hash, uint256 amount) public {
        commits[msg.sender] = Commit(hash, amount);
    }

    function revealSwap(uint256 amount, uint256 nonce) public {
        Commit memory commit = commits[msg.sender];
        require(commit.hash == keccak256(abi.encodePacked(amount, nonce)), "Invalid commit");
        require(balances[msg.sender] >= amount * price, "Insufficient balance");

        balances[msg.sender] -= amount * price;
        delete commits[msg.sender];
        // Transfer tokens (omitted for simplicity)
    }
}
```

## Conclusion

Front-running can lead to significant losses in blockchain systems. By understanding the types of front-running and implementing prevention strategies like commit-reveal schemes, random delays, and transaction encryption, you can build more secure smart contracts.
